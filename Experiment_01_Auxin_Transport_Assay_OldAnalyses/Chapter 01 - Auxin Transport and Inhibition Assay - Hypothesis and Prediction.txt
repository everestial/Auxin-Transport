	Mayodan population exhibits higher apical dominance compared to Spiterstulen population. 
	This variation in apical dominance contributes to variation in several key life history traits.

	1) Auxin transport assay (Note: experiment 01, has no technical replicates) 
	- Individuals from mayodan population exhibit lower apical dominance.

	2) Auxin inhibition assay (Note: experiment 01, this has data only from population Mayodan)
	- Altering the apical dominance in individuals representing Mayodan population will affect/alter it's life history traits like
		- shoot architecture (measured by intesity of lateral shoots)
		- number of reproductive shoots (inflorescence)
		- change in diameter

Predictions:
	1) Auxin transport assay
	- Measure of H3-IAA in inflorescence shoots of Mayodan will show higher transport.
	
	2) Auxin inhibition assay
	- During the month of September (when auxin inhibition has just started)
		- there should be no significant difference in diameter, lateral shoot rating, number of inflorescence
	
	- During the month of December (when auxin inhibition has started showing it's effect)
		- there should be significant difference in diameter, lateral shoot rating, number of inflorescence
			between different treatment groups, treatment levels
		- this significant difference should not stem from family based differences.
		  i.e the ANOVA test of significance should account for family based effects. We expect family based effects is not significant.
		
		- Other possible tests?
			- Does lateral shoot rating affect diameter changes?
			- Does lateral shoot rating affect number of inflorescences?

		- Effects of treatment over time
		  NPA-Sep		NPA-Dec		NPA-March
		  WD-Sep		WD-Dec		WD-March
		

	- During the month of March (when auxin inhibition had been stopped for few months)
		- the plants in treatment groups should recover it's diameter showing no significant differences against non-treated plants
